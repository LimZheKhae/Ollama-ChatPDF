      "The launch of the Global Cooperation Barometer comes at the start of a crucial year, amid a period of immense geopolitical, geo-economic and market uncertainty, when the bedrock of what was once a stable global system is shifting underfoot. Leaders in the public and private sectors will need to gain fluency in the dynamics driving the changes to not just stabilize their position, but to be equipped to shape a beneficial future.\n",
      "\n",
      "seeking opportunities for collaboration. Notably, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union coordinated on eradicating smallpox and addressing the ozone layer in the atmosphere. And many companies that compete with one another also find ways to cooperate in areas of mutual benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is within today’s complex geopolitical context that gaining an understanding of the shape of global cooperation – and competition – is vital. Leaders in business and government will need to recognize where the contours of opposition end and those of alignment begin to navigate through the geopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more cooperative future.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no secret that the current global context is concerning, as heightened competition and conflict appear to be replacing cooperation. The result is that new power dynamics, changing demographic realities and breakthrough frontier technologies are raising the temperature on long-simmering distrust rather than fueling opportunities for benefit. Many businesses are responding to these complicated – and often fraught – geopolitical developments by shifting operations and facilities closer to home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is for this reason that the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company developed the Global Cooperation Barometer. The purpose of this analysis, which uses 42 indicators to measure the state of global cooperation broadly and along five areas, is to help stakeholders in business and government gain a better understanding of the nature of cooperation that is, or is not, taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaders in business and government will need to recognize where the contours of opposition end and those of alignment begin to navigate through the geopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more cooperative future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, although the world is heading towards a dangerous divide by some measures, elsewhere there are prospects for and progress on cooperative arrangements. For instance, for the first time since countries began meeting to address global warming, an agreement was reached at the COP28 climate change conference on transitioning away from fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hope is that the Global Cooperation Barometer will offer stakeholders a tool to use in shaping a healthier, more prosperous and more sustainable world in the year ahead and beyond.\n",

      "About the Global Cooperation Barometer\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Cooperation Barometer is structured along five dimensions of global connection: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "These five pillars were chosen because of their impact on global development and their explicit dependence on cooperative efforts among nations and economies. As a guiding element in the analysis, the barometer identified goals that actors are working toward in each of these themes. In doing so, the barometer draws inspiration from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the efforts of other global institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To quantify change in these pillars, 42 indicators were identified that research suggests are either cooperative actions that advance progress on the goals of the pillars or demonstrate a broad outcome from those actions. Cooperative action metrics measure actions that provide evidence of cooperation; these indicators (such as flows of goods and exchange of intellectual property) are evidence of\n",
      "\n",
      "real, manifested cooperation and do not include “on paper” commitments. Outcome metrics (such as life expectancy) measure the progress of cooperation, but typically are influenced by additional factors beyond just cooperation. The metrics span countries in all geographies and all levels of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barometer looks back at the last 11 years, from 2012 through 2022 to establish a trend line of cooperation. It indexes data to 2020 for the following reason: as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, it accelerated many trends existing in business and society and set in motion many new ones. Indexing the time series to 2020 allows us to see what trends were in place before the pandemic, and the trends that emerged from it (without influencing or distorting the trends themselves). Note that some metrics have been inverted such that any increase represents a positive development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology used for the Global Cooperation Barometer is outlined below. Details on sourcing of individual metrics are in the Appendix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Cooperation Barometer’s 5 pillars of global cooperation\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade and capital\n",
      "\n",
      "Promote global development and resilience Focus of analysis is on i) development and resilient outcomes; through ii) presence of global economic flows that promote likely opportunities for these outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovation and technology\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Indexed trendlines\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Geography\n",
      "\n",
      "Across all metrics, the barometer aims to collect global data. In most cases, an aggregate global weighted average is available. When a global weighted average is not available, the most comprehensive data is used (e.g. OECD countries, or a sample set of countries where data is available for all years).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Years\n",
      "\n",
      "While the barometer measures cooperation from 2012 through 2022, a few metrics do not have data for all years. All metrics have 2020 data to ensure the indexed trendline can be calculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data from 2020 serves as the base year to develop comparable trendlines, with all values in 2020 equal to 1 (2020=1). This base-year standardization is the basis of the score calculation, enabling a uniform reference point for all metrics and comparability, despite different units and datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Data normalization\n",
      "\n",
      "Where possible, metrics are normalized to ensure that trendlines can be assessed independently of the effects of economic growth or population changes. For example, trade, capital, and other financial flows are normalized to global GDP, while migration metrics are normalized to global population levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Weighting\n",
      "\n",
      "Index calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "To evaluate global cooperation fairly and compare trendlines of the action and outcome metrics across the five pillars, the global cooperation barometer applies the following methodology:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each pillar comprises two indices: an action index and an outcome index. To arrive at each, the metrics within are weighted equally (i.e. the action index is a simple average of metrics measuring cooperative actions). The overall index for a pillar is calculated as an average of the action and outcome metrics. Aggregate indices across pillars are also calculated as a simple average of pillar indices (i.e. equal weighting across pillars).\n",

      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive summary Cooperation is multifaceted and can coexist with competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is facing complex challenges. Addressing them demands cooperation at the global level.\n",
      "\n",
      "After trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation risks moving into reverse. The story varies by pillar:\n",
      "\n",
      "Today’s economy is in a fragile state, with growth expected to be well below the historical average, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).1 Revitalizing trade will be crucial to strengthening the economic outlook ahead and boosting livelihoods. However, the IMF has raised alarms about the possibility of global fragmentation, which could shave off 7% of global GDP.2\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, technological innovation is key to boosting currently sluggish productivity growth, with generative artificial intelligence (AI) holding extraordinary potential – $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in additional annual value across industries, as estimated by the McKinsey Global Institute.3 The only way to unlock this benefit and manage undesirable consequences is through global coordination.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Trade and capital: trade and capital cooperation\n",
      "\n",
      "grew through the pandemic disruption, but slowed in 2023; geopolitical tensions and new restrictions make the future path unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "–\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovation and technology: flows of data, IP and international students powered an increase in cooperation until 2020, but new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Climate and natural capital: the level of\n",
      "\n",
      "cooperation for climate and natural capital has been rising steadily, due in large measure to an increase in commitments, but emissions also continue to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change requires governments and businesses to work together to reach net zero, adapt to shifts in climate already locked in by previous emissions, and do all of this in a way that supports economic development across the globe. Just like the health of the planet, the health of people requires cooperation globally between governments and businesses. Long-term advancements in health and immediate responses to acute crises like pandemics require parties around the world to work together. Yet, in terms of addressing the health and well-being of people and the planet, the world appears off course, with just 15% of the Sustainable Development Goals on track.4\n",
      "\n",
      "– Health and wellness: cooperation in health and wellness rose swiftly in response to the pandemic, but appears to be settling back to historical patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Peace and security: cooperation in peace and security has declined since 2016 and plummeted recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it is unlikely that the current geopolitical climate will change and competition and confrontation will soon cool, the barometer suggests that leaders in business and government should reimagine cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, as cooperation is becoming an imperative, the world order appears to be fragmenting. Indeed, the global security landscape – once a largely cooperative domain in the post-Cold War era – is deteriorating, with the United Nations noting at the start of 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest number of violent conflicts since World War II.5\n",
      "\n",
      "The barometer shows that cooperation is multifaceted, and elements of cooperation can coexist with elements of rivalry. Leaders can practice “coopetition” – balancing cooperation and competition – to advance shared interests in specific areas, despite lack of alignment elsewhere. Further, leaders can use these instances of cooperation to build mutual trust, which in turn could strengthen cooperation in other areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 presents an approach to measure the current state of global cooperation. In doing so, the report is meant to serve as a tool for leaders to better understand the contours of cooperation broadly and along five pillars – trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, companies and countries should remember that cooperation breeds strength and resilience. Those that thoughtfully and constructively manage relationships bounce back better from challenges and achieve objectives.6\n",
      "\n",
      "6\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction The state of global cooperation Measuring cooperation is a critical step in identifying ways to strengthening it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is facing a plethora of challenges that require global cooperation to solve. Global temperatures shattered previous highs and last year was the hottest on record.7 And, over 114 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide – the highest level ever.8 At the same time, ongoing threats of a pandemic and the risks of new, unregulated technologies warrant concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooperation is not only necessary as a reactive mechanism to address threatening global developments, but it is also needed to unlock new opportunities. Indeed, generative AI has the potential to contribute as much as $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy, but requires substantial coordination across the global ecosystem to mitigate risks and ensure benefits are shared widely.9\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent history has shown that global cooperation can deliver profound benefits. During the first quarter-century after the end of the Cold War – a period largely seen as a high point for global cooperation – expanded trade lifted global incomes and as a result, the number of people living in extreme poverty was cut in half.10 Instances of the international community reflexively coming together during this period are most evident through security coordination in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, financial coordination in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, which included upgrading the G20, and global commitments to address the growing danger of climate change through the 2015 signing of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the challenging context, the story about global cooperation is not black and white. Countries and companies can compete while also cooperating. Competition, and even confrontation, can spike in one area while cooperation can deepen in others. In a notable example, in 2022, amid heightened tensions between the United States and China, as climate negotiations between both countries were suspended and talk of decoupling dominated airwaves, bilateral trade reached record levels.13\n",
      "\n",
      "To help develop a better understanding of the current state of global cooperation, this report presents the Global Cooperation Barometer – a tool that examines cooperation in five pillars: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. The five pillars were chosen because, given the interconnected nature of the world, cooperation at the global level is necessary to see advancements in each of these areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the barometer indicates that after trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down 2%) since 2020 (Figure 1). The period from 2012 to the pandemic was marked by increased cooperation across four of the five pillars (peace and security was the exception), led by innovation and technology’s more than 30% increase in cooperation (Figure 2). However, in more recent years new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities that arise from innovation.\n",

      "\n",
      "barometer indicates that after trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down 2%) since 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "By many accounts, the geopolitical dial turned from cooperation to competition in the mid-2010s, as nationalist forces increased in many countries and protectionist policies rose.11 The dial then turned further away from cooperation as conflict broke out in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with the UN warning in early 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest level of violent conflict since World War II.12\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic and the years that followed shook up trade and capital flows. Despite this, there has been a continued net increase, though it has been moderate. Trade flows fell in the immediate wake of quarantines and then rebounded strongly. At the onset of the pandemic, consumer demand decreased sharply and some production and shipping ground to a halt. Yet, trade soon rebounded as homebound consumers started spending more on goods. Countries remained interconnected and cooperative out of necessity as the world navigated a once-in-a-century event and this pattern persisted through 2022. For example, from 2021 to 2022, the flow of goods as a share of GDP increased by 10%, reaching a historical peak at 51% of GDP (up from 46.7% in 2021).\n",

For example, the United States has been trading more with Mexico and Viet Nam, and China has increased trade and investment across South-East Asia.\n",

Closing this gap between more and less integrated countries could lead to significant economic benefits. The question is whether leaders will work to rebuild the economic connections needed to promote growth, foster diversity, provide resilience, improve domestic economies and ensure that vulnerable people are not left behind.\n",

Rapid growth in technological streams such as intellectual property and data far outpaced growth in physical goods exchanges,18 with global data flows tripling and IT services trade doubling. At the same time, both the numbers of international students and cross-border R&D activity grew steadily.\n",

The fall in cost reflected cooperation of countries across the global supply chain (e.g. basic research conducted in the US and Japan; mass production capabilities in China, where 70%+ of global supply originates; and extraction of raw materials in Australia and Chile, among other countries).19\n",

The race to dominate the frontiers of technology development has led to import and export bans on 5G network technologies, limitations on semiconductors and bans on some social media platforms.21 From 2021-2022, restrictions on products in the IT goods sector grew five times faster than trade restrictions overall. Trade in IT goods and intermediates (e.g. laptop components) as a share of GDP declined by 5% during the same period. The share of cross-border patents also fell sharply to the lowest point in the past decade. And cross-border data flows declined by 2%.\n",

For example, the US and China collaborated on AI publications more than any other country pair from 2010 to 2021. The number of publications grew roughly four-fold since 2010, but only 2.1% from 2020 to 2021.22 Broadening the potential base of collaborative networks (potentially through the continued expansion of universities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) or increased public sector support of exchange programmes for researchers) will be important to minimizing the potential for the gains of innovation and technology to become increasingly concentrated in fewer hands.\n",

      "in the pandemic longstanding institutions such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) saw their budgets rise by 15% from pre-COVID levels37 and continued growth in funding is needed. New mechanisms, like the G20’s $1.4 billion Pandemic Fund38 and the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM), offer promising avenues for continued collaboration.39 The WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness Treaty (to be considered in 2024) is a prime example of international cooperation in progress, demonstrating how global leaders are working together to enhance pandemic prevention and response efforts through a comprehensive treaty framework.40\n",

Life expectancy at birth declined from 72.8 to 71.0 from 2019 to 2021. Malaria deaths rose by 10% from 2019 to 2020.36 And maternal mortality rates increased for the first time in three decades.\n",

International partnerships will play an integral role in coordinating and deepening basic research on a variety of health conditions, ranging from chronic disease to accelerating approaches to clinical trials on frontier conditions.41 Sustained cooperation is needed to tackle the continued proliferation of synthetic drugs globally (of which the UN Synthetic Drug Strategy in 2021 and the July 2023 launch of the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats42 are two prominent examples). There is significant potential to coordinate emerging best practices to support improved outcomes in mental health in the working- age population (e.g. approaches to support/leave for parents and caregivers).43 Finally, coordinated approaches are needed to engage and increase participation of ageing populations (where the global population of people over the age of 65 is forecast to reach 16.5% by 2050, up from 9.4% today).44\n",

      "\n",
      "Although the number of global conflicts declined from approximately 18,000 in 2012 to 13,000 in 2020, suggesting that peace and security had improved, other indicators show a deteriorating landscape. Forcible displacement has grown markedly, with the number of forcibly displaced people nearly doubling between 2012 and 2020 (from 42 million to 82 million). Syria accounted for 24% of the additional 40 million people; Venezuela 12% and Yemen 8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second development also lowered the score for global cooperation on peace and security – cyberspace became a new theater for conflicts. Between 2012 and 2020, significant cyberattacks45 quadrupled in number and became more costly. It is estimated that global cybercrime cost the world economy $1 trillion in 2020.46 Cyberattackers have reached across national borders to target space systems and other critical infrastructure, sent malware attacks against central private sector organizations (like oil companies47), conducted the first successful attack on a power grid,48 breached defenses at government agencies49 and attacked health system infrastructure.50\n",

      "\n",
      "The devastating human costs of conflicts have grown immensely over the last two years. Though the level of conflict is similar to 2014, today’s battles are proving more deadly and destructive. In recent years, fatalities from conflict have risen dramatically to roughly 240,000 in 2022 – a nearly three-fold increase since 2020 and well above the previous peak of 150,000 in 2014. On average, deaths per conflict remained steady between 2012 and 2020 but have more than doubled since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, global attempts at conflict resolution have not kept pace. The ratio of United Nations Security Council resolutions to the number of conflicts was 0.43:1 in 2020; that fell to 0.31:1 in 2022. Similarly, the ratio of peacekeeping operations to conflicts was 0.47:1 in 2020 and 0.36:1 in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting vulnerable populations could start by addressing two critical needs. The first is managing the integration of refugee populations from conflict zones. For example, 58% of Ukraine’s 6.4 million refugees have now moved beyond Ukraine’s immediately neighbouring countries and may place strains on the social net or cohesion of Europe’s poorer countries if not integrated.53 The UN’s Regional Refugee Response Plan, a well-organized and rapidly scaled international humanitarian aid programme, provides an example of how to address critical immediate needs.54 Supporting leading practices in improving the integration of refugees in the medium term will be essential for allowing both refugees and host communities to benefit from these shifts,55 especially given tight labour market conditions in developed countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forcible displacement also rose sharply in 2022, reaching a record for the period (of 2012-2022) at 108.4 million people,51 up from 89.3 million in 2021 (an increase of ~18%). More than 13 million people from Syria were displaced, as were 11.6 million from Ukraine and 10.2 million from Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of cyberattacks, the number of significant cyberattacks remained stable from 2020 to 2022, at around 11.3 per month. However, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian attacks on Ukraine internet users rose by 250% and attacks on NATO countries by more than 300% in the same period, and these cyberattacks were coordinated with kinetic attacks to support ground efforts, representing a new twist in cyberwarfare.52\n",
      "\n",
      "The second is identifying mechanisms and approaches that will support impacted individuals in conflict zones, particularly inflows of funds to support the provision of basic needs and reduce friction in aid flows without compromising compliance, security, and risk standards. This will require close collaboration between public sector approaches to financial crime regulation, private sector organizations with expertise in money transmission and the 10 million non-profit organizations who serve across a variety of needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, given the evolving nature of cyberattacks and potential linkages to kinetic efforts, there is a need for redoubling cooperative efforts in the cyber domain, integrating public and private sector actors to boost sharing of data flows on cybersecurity threats, and identifying patterns of anomalous activity and new threat vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support for vulnerable populations and cyber collaboration\n",
      "\n",

      "Practice “coopetition” Amid an era of heightened geopolitical competition, parties should not take competition to mean cooperation is impossible, or that a decline in cooperation in one area means cooperation is impossible elsewhere. Instead, parties should focus on identifying avenues toward advancing shared interest that can exist despite competition – a practice known in the private sector as “coopetition”.56\n",

      "role of their organization in supporting global cooperation in specific areas or with specific outcomes in mind. This may also require upgrading the board’s understanding given the complexities and nuances of these issues, drawing on the latest research and frameworks. Boards may want to invite global experts for regular sessions to discuss the latest developments, potential scenarios, and implications for the organization. Boards should also be more proactive in pressure- testing management on the potential controls or mitigations established to counteract the impact of declines in global cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use cooperation to beget cooperation While cooperation can coexist with competition, cooperation can also be used to increase overall trust and diminish unnecessary rivalry or conflict.

      "\n",
      "Raise the capabilities of management Every company, especially the largest multinationals, will be touched in some way by the ongoing mutations in globalization (including global trade flows).57 Cooperation needs to be treated like a muscle that can be strengthened and can react well in the face of geopolitical shocks. An understanding of both global connections and geopolitical realities – and implications for the business – should be a core competency for every multinational corporation C-suite executive.58 That means not just understanding the headlines, but having a subtle grasp of the nuances, context and potential implications for the business.\n",

      "\n",
      "Build dynamic strategic options The old paradigm of globalization largely depended on businesses shaping the way. Now governments are moving back into the lead, and this is likely to be a core consideration for every multinational. A starting point here will be a careful and clinical diagnostic of each firm’s interconnectedness – where, with whom, how – combined with a rigorous risk assessment of potential points of weakness. That understanding will form the basis for detailed scenario planning, including resilient alternatives for supply chains, and the elaboration of new strategy options that take into account dynamic world events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think diversifying, not decoupling Companies and countries that thoughtfully manage their concentrated exposures are likely to be more resilient – not only able to absorb a supply disruption, but also to bounce back better. There is already evidence of this in action: in April 2022, 81% of global supply-chain leaders surveyed said they had initiated dual sourcing of raw materials, up 26 percentage points from the previous year. Greater diversification not only strengthens resilience; it could also promote a more inclusive trading system and economy.59 The connection between trade and wealth creation is strong: diversification could enable more countries to participate more fully.\n",
